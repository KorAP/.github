**KorAP** is a corpus analysis platform that is suitable for very large, multiply annotated corpora and complex search queries, independent of specific research questions.

The [main instance of KorAP](https://korap.ids-mannheim.de/) serves the [German Reference Corpus DeReKo](https://www.ids-mannheim.de/digspra/kl/projekte/korpora/).

The platform consists of several components, which are published as separate repositories.
It is mainly developed at the [Leibniz Institute for German Language](https://www.ids-mannheim.de).
